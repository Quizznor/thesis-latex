Specifically, we overview open questions on the origin of the bulk of UHECRs, the UHECR mass composition, the origin of the end of the cosmic-ray spectrum, the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays, the effect of magnetic fields on the trajectories of UHECRs, anisotropy expectations for specific astrophysical scenarios, hadronic interactions, and prospects for discovering neutral particles as well as new physics at ultrahigh energies. We also briefly overview upcoming and proposed UHECR experiments and discuss their projected science reach.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable in plain ASCII are indicated by [...]. Abstract is included in .pdf document. The attenuation of ultraviolet radiation by air near the ground was measured as a function of wavelength under a wide variety of meteorological conditions. These measurements were made over the tops of buildings at the California Institute of Technology on 125 nights between March 1949 and March 1950. Attenuation coefficients in km[...] have been plotted against wavelengths in Angstroms for 78 representative nights. The primary data were obtained from four independent experiments, two which yielded coefficients as a continuous function of wavelength from 2300A to 4600A, and two which monitored coefficients at 2537A and at 5500A. The first method employed photographic spectrophotometry to compare the light transmitted through two paths differing in length by 680 meters. The second method was similar but utilized other apparatus and a path difference of 340 meters. The third method involved mercury lamps and cadmium photocells, and the fourth method consisted of visual observations with a Loofah hazemeter. Except for the Herzberg 02 bands in the neighborhood of 2500A, the attenuation coefficient was found to vary smoothly (though differently) with wavelength on all nights analyzed, including many when smog was present in noticeable concentrations. Attenuation data for unpolluted air were successfully fitted by a simple empirical formula involving wavelength and visibility range as parameters.},

Prof. Watson, of the University of Leeds, has led the field over the past four decades, culminating in his work with Prof. Jim Cronin of the University of Chicago to establish the Pierre Auger Observatory in Argentina. The observatory detected an anisotropy in the arrival direction of the highest energy cosmic rays, described in the medal citation as possibly “the most significant experimental discovery made to date in particle astrophysics”.},

This time interval covered the decrease in solar activity from the maximum of solar cycle 21 to solar minimum and the onset of cycle 22. The sun's ultraviolet irradiance also decreased during the descending phase of cycle 21 and, like the total irradiance, is now increasing concurrently with the increase in cycle 22 activity. Although only 1 percent of the sun's energy is emitted at ultraviolet wavelengths between 200 and 300 nanometers, the decrease in this radiation from 1 July 1981 to 30 June 1985 accounted for 19 percent of the decrease in the total irradiance over the same period.},

  abstract = {The Pierre Auger Collaboration is releasing 10\% of the data recorded since 2004 using the world's largest cosmic ray detector, the Pierre Auger Observatory, located in Argentina, in the Province of Mendoza. The release also includes 100\% of weather and space-weather data collected until 31 December 2020. These data are being made available publicly with the expectation that they will be used by a wide and diverse community including professional and citizen-scientists and for educational and outreach initiatives. Operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory, by a Collaboration of about 400 scientists from over 90 institutions in 18 countries across the world, has enabled the properties of the highest-energy cosmic rays to be determined with unprecedented precision. These cosmic rays are predominantly the nuclei of the common elements and reach the Earth from astrophysical sources. The data from the Observatory have been used to show that the highest-energy particles have an extra-galactic origin. Cosmic rays are observed indirectly, through extensive air-showers of secondary particles produced by the interaction of the incoming cosmic ray with the atmosphere. The Surface Detector of the Observatory covers 3000 km2 and comprises an array of \textasciitilde 1600 particle detectors, separated by 1500 m. The low energy extension features an array of 71 stations spread apart by 750 m and covering about 27 km2. The area is overlooked by a set of telescopes that compose the Fluorescence Detector which is sensitive to the auroral-like light emitted as the air-shower develops, while the Surface Detector is sensitive to muons, electrons and photons that reach the ground. The Open Data released here include those from these instruments. They have been subjected to the same selection and reconstruction procedures used by the Collaboration in recent publications. They amount to more than 80000 showers measured with the surface-detector arrays and more than 3000 showers recorded simultaneously by the surface and fluorescence detectors. Data are available as pseudo-raw (JSON) format and as a summary CSV file containing the reconstructed shower parameters. Simplified codes derived from the ones used for published analyses are also provided, by means of Python notebooks that have been prepared to guide the reader to an understanding of the physics results. An outreach section dedicated to the general public, and in particular to school students, is also available and includes simple tools to enjoy our data. To get more details about the Observatory and the Open Data, you can visit the dedicated website. About the Auger Open Data Downloadable datasets ~Cosmic-ray data: Pseudo-raw data: for each event, a list of SD stations, with their relevant PMT traces, is available. If an event is detected simultaneously with the SD and FD it is called a hybrid event and a list of FD telescopes with a camera view is also provided. The main parameters from the SD and FD reconstruction are also given. The 'ready-to-use' Event Display is a good way to become familiar with the Open Data. Reconstructed data: for each event, only 'high-level' information is provided. Different parameters are extracted from the pseudo-raw dataset to be used in physics analysis. Examples on how to use them can be found in the Analysis page. Atmospheric data: Pseudo-raw data: the values of different atmospheric state-variables, recorded using each of the five weather stations, are available. Processed data: the values of the different atmospheric state- variables, obtained by merging the information from the different weather stations, are provided. Scaler data: the counting rate of the surface detectors over 15 minutes, averaged over the active detectors, is provided. Auxiliary data: these are additional data necessary for a full physics analysis but that are not extracted directly from the raw data. They include the position of the SD stations, the position of the FD pixels, the SD exposure, the FD acceptance. Pseudo-raw and reconstructed data are provided in JSON format. Reconstructed data are also available in CSV format, representing a “summary” of the JSON files and containing the information that is needed for analysis. Similarly, auxiliary data are in CSV format. Format description is available on~the dedicated website.

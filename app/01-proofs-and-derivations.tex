\section{Approximating the UV Irradiance of an EAS}
\label{app:cr-uv-irradiance}

In the following, we estimate the UV irradiance, $I_\text{UV}$, or Wattage 
deposited per area, from fluorescence light stemming from an extensive air 
shower. To illustrate that telescopes need to be incredibly sensitive to 
observe this phenomenon, we assume fantastic to unrealistically good conditions
for the \UV light yield and related parameters. This thus results in a very 
optimistic upper limit to $I_\text{UV}$.

We consider an \EAS of energy $E_0 = \SI{e18}{\eV}$ and inclination 
$\uptheta=\SI{15}{\degree}$. We assume the behaviour of the particle cascade 
resulting from the deeply inelastic is completely determined by the 
Heitler-Matthews model (see \todo{write this} and 
\cite{Matthews2005, Risse2006}). We arrive at the following value for the 
atmospheric depth (height), at which the shower reaches its maximum in 
multiplicity:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:irradiance-multiplicity}
\Xmax \approx \SI{700}{\gram\per\centi\meter\squared}\qquad\left(\;\widehat{\approx}\;\SI{18.5}{\kilo\meter}\;\text{above earth surface}\footnotemark\right).
\end{equation}
\footnotetext{The calculated height above surface that corresponds to the given 
atmospheric depth varies a lot based on atmospheric variables. We have assumed a
purely isothermic atmosphere with $T=\SI{278}{\kelvin}$, and a standard density 
of $\rho=\SI{0.86}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}$ at an altitude of 
\SI{1400}{\meter} above sea level.}

At $\Xmax$, the EM component of the shower contains roughly
$1-\left(E_0\,/\,\xi^\pi_C\right)^{\beta-1}\approx92\%$ of the primary particle 
energy, with photons and electrons sharing the fraction to roughly equal parts.
Since only electrons contribute meaningfully to excitations of air molecules, it 
follows that $E_\text{UV}=0.92\cdot0.5\cdot\SI{e18}{\electronvolt}=
\SI{4.6e17}{\electronvolt}$ are available a priori to create fluorescence light.
We take an optimistic estimate of the fluorescence light yield 
$\text{FY}\approx8\gamma\,/\,\SI{}{\mega\electronvolt}$ from \cite{Keilhauer2013}. 
The majority of these photons will stem from the 2P(0,0) transition of 
N$_2$ \cite{Ave2008}, which has a characteristic wavelength of 
\SI{337.1}{\nano\meter}, and an average radiation time of \SI{42}{\nano\second} 
\cite{Lean1989}. We assume that all available energy $E_\text{UV}$ is immediately 
converted to molecular excitations of N$_2$ at $\Xmax$, and then gradually 
released according to an exponential decay and recover an expression for the (UV) 
power output of the air shower.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:irradiance-power}
P(t)= \text{FY}\,E_\text{UV}\,\frac{hc}{\SI{337.1}{\nano\meter}} \cdot\frac{e^{-\SI{42}{\nano\second}/t}}{t}   
\end{equation}

This results in a maximum power output of $P_\text{max}\approx\SI{19.4}{\watt}$. 
In a last step, we convert the maximum power output to an irradiance measured on
ground. For this, we must take into acount that the area illuminated by the 
\UV-light grows proportional to the distance squared to the source (location of 
$\Xmax$). Furthermore, \UV-light is attenuated by the atmosphere. More 
specifically, UV light with a wavelength of \SI{337}{\nano\meter} drops in 
intensity by about 13\%/km in clear conditions 
\cite[see Fig. 83 on page 103 of][]{Baum1950}. Supposing that an observer is at
least $d=\SI{18.5}{\kilo\meter}$ away from $\Xmax$ (compare 
\cref{eq:irradiance-multiplicity}), we estimate the total irradiance this 
observer measures as

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:irradiance}
I_\text{UV} = P_\text{max}\,\frac{e^{-0.14\,\frac{d}{\SI{}{\kilo\meter}}}}{4\pi\,d^2}\approx\SI{0.32}{\nano\watt\per\square\meter}.
\end{equation}

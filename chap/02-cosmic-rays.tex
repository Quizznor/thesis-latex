\chapter{Cosmic rays and extensive air showers}
\label{chap:cosmic-rays}

\CRs are particles of extraterrestrial origin that travel very close to the 
speed of light. Their relativistic kinetic energy $pc$ far surpasses their rest 
mass $mc^2$. In particular, \UHECRs are typically defined as \CRs with energies
exceeding $\SI{1}{\exa\eV} = \SI{e18}{\eV}$ \cite{AlvesBatista2019}. These
microscopic fragments originate from some of the most dynamic processes in the 
universe. As such, they are of great interest to researchers. Not only do they 
hold the key to understanding particle interactions at extremely high energies 
and small scales, but can also improve the understanding of the cosmos over the
largest distances.

\section{Origin and Source Mechanisms}
\label{sec:cr-accelerators}

Two questions are of very high importance in unravelling the mysteries 
surrounding \CRs and \UHE-physics. How and where do particles attain such 
incredible energies? The identification of \CR sources is consequently a very 
active area of research
